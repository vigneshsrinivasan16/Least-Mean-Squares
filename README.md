# Least-Mean-Squares

LMS algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB. The order of the optimal filter is 100. The random vector elements are i.i.d Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance. The added noise elements are also i.i.d Gaussian random Variables with zero mean and unit variance.
